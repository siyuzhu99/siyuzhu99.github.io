      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My current research interests focus on literacy (i.e., reading and writing) development assessment, including 
        
        1. AI-assisted writing instruction and assessment;
        2. the role of psychological mechanisms in literacy development and assessment;
        3. online multimodal reading assessment. 
        
        My research subjects include Chinese L1 and L2 learners as well as English L2 learners, with a primary focus on K-12 students, while also covering undergraduate students, graduate students, and pre-service teachers. Based on my research interests, I have participated in multiple research projects supported by schools and government agencies and have produced a substantial body of research publications.
