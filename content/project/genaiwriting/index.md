This research focus is conducted under the supervision and collaboration of Prof. Zhu Xinhua.

## Research Background
The emergence of Generative AI technologies, particularly large language models like ChatGPT, has fundamentally disrupted traditional writing pedagogy and assessment practices. While these AI tools offer unprecedented opportunities to support student writing development through instant feedback, personalized guidance, and scaffolded learning experiences, they also raise critical questions about academic integrity, authentic assessment, and the evolving nature of writing competencies in the AI era.

As educational institutions grapple with whether to ban or embrace these technologies, there is an urgent need for evidence-based approaches to integrating Generative AI into writing instruction effectively and ethically. Understanding how AI can complement rather than replace human teaching, and how assessment practices must evolve to remain valid and meaningful in AI-mediated contexts, has become essential for educators worldwide.

## Research Focuses
**1.Teacher Professional Development with GenAI**
Providing quality writing feedback is challenging for pre-service teachers due to limited classroom experience and pedagogical expertise. This project explores how professional development interventions can equip pre-service teachers to effectively use ChatGPT as a supportive tool in their feedback practices. The research examines both the development of practical skills in working with GenAI and the building of teacher confidence in AI-assisted contexts. This work aims to inform teacher education programs on strategies for preparing future educators to integrate GenAI technologies responsibly and effectively into writing instruction.
