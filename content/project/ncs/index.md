This research is being pursued under the guidance and collaboration of Prof. Zhu Xinhua and Prof. Chan Shui-Duen.

## Reseach Background
The introduction of the bi-literacy and trilingualism policy in Hong Kong in 1997 created unprecedented challenges for non-Chinese speaking (NCS) students learning Chinese as a second language. Research has documented that NCS students comprehend only approximately 70% of the teaching syllabus and consistently underperform in reading comprehension compared to their native-speaking peers. This achievement gap is particularly concerning given that reading proficiency serves as the cornerstone of overall academic success, and early elementary years represent a critical window for reading development.

Despite the well-established importance of early reading development and the documented challenges facing NCS learners, there remains a significant research gap regarding the reading performance and underlying psychological factors that influence young children learning Chinese as a second language. Understanding the mechanisms and characteristics of Chinese reading development among immigrant children is essential for developing effective instructional interventions and supporting educational equity in Hong Kong's increasingly diverse linguistic landscape. This research addresses this critical need by examining how NCS students develop Chinese reading skills during this pivotal developmental period.

## Reseach Focuses
**The Impact of Psychological Mechanisms on Chinese Reading Development in School-Age Children**
This research examines how key psychological factors—including intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, ideal L2 self, reading engagement, and self-beliefs—influence Chinese reading development among non-Chinese speaking students in Hong Kong. A particular emphasis is placed on comparative analyses between L2 and L1 Chinese learners to identify distinct developmental patterns and challenges. By uncovering these psychological mechanisms, this work aims to inform targeted interventions that address the specific needs of second language readers.

**Shaping Chinese Reading Psychology and Performance: The Role of Family Environment and Parental Involvement**
This project investigates how family dynamics shape Chinese reading development among immigrant children from a longitudinal perspective. The research examines how parental attitudes toward Chinese learning, the quality and nature of parental involvement, and the broader home literacy environment influence students' motivation and self-beliefs in L2 Chinese reading. A key focus is understanding the moderating effects of family factors on reading performance trajectories over time, revealing how sustained parental support or lack thereof impacts long-term reading development.
